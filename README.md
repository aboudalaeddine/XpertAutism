# xpert_autism



## Getting Started

Our program includes a questionnaire based on a synthesis of autism differential diagnosis methodologies (ADI-R, L'ADOS-2, Les CARS).
This work is part of an autistic children's care initiative.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
